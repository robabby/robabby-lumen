Hey there!  My name is Rob, and I am a design-minded frontend developer focused on collaborating with Product, User Experience, and development teams.  I have a passion for building high-functioning, cross-disciplinary teams that focus on a user-centered discovery process where asking creative questions and challenging the status quo is encouraged.

*An example of a high-functioning team in action.*

I acknowledge that not all problems can be solved with code, and nothing is more fulfilling than finding a group of people who can infuse the passion for their craft with a mutual purpose to grow and have an impact together.  I no longer have much patience for *ninjas* and *rockstars*, and instead prefer surrounding myself with people who are humble and driven.  Untapped potential excites me, and providing people with a platform to create and collaborate effectively in a supportive and encouraging environment is one of my favorite ways to contribute and nurture individual growth.

When creating a team, aligning people with compatible values, abilities and skills (in that order) will ensure that the group will form a strong bond, and before long you will be cultivating both meaningful work and meaningful relationships.
