Hey there!  My name is Rob, and I am a design-minded individual who has enjoyed collaborating with Product, User Experience, and development teams in a startup environment.  I have a passion for high-functioning, cross-disciplinary teams that focus on an agile, user-centered discovery process where collaboration and growth are the core values.  I love working with people who can infuse the passion for what they do with a purpose beyond themselves to cultivate meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

I have a knack for bringing different people with different disciplines and backgrounds together and helping to improve collaboration.  Where I excel is building bridges between groups of people (like product and development teams) and helping to promote collaboration and communication.  At SAVO I was fortunate enough to play a role in building a cross-disciplinary UI/UX team, and together we impacted nearly every aspect of SAVO's organization. Together we improved our process, culture, and software in the eyes of both our customers and our stakeholders.

I am now offering my set of talents, abilities and skills to the market as a freelance developer and consultant.  I am accepting work from anyone who thinks that the value I bring aligns with the goals of their business or organization.  With experience in Freelancing, Product Ownership, Software Development, and User Experience, I can help you solve problems and reach outcomes that were previously unobtainable.

## I can help with the following:

<!-- I am coming off of a 5 year stint working as a Senior User Experience & Product Developer for [The SAVO Group](http://savogroup.com/).  SAVO was recently acquired by [Seismic](https://seismic.com/) which ended many peoples tenure there, myself included.  Over my time at SAVO the company was continually transforming, and each chapter taught me an incredible deal about the the world of software development.  Sometime soon I will write a post detailing my experience at SAVO and reflect on my experiences.

SAVO allowed me to refine my craft, and gain exposure to new teams and concepts like User Experience, Agile, and practicing Lean Methodologies.  As my perception expanded I learned to embrace that not all problems can be solved with code. I was fortunate enough to play a role in building a team who infused the passion for their craft with a mutual purpose to grow and have an impact together.  We quickly grew into an amazing UI/UX team, and together we impacted nearly every aspect of SAVO's organization.   -->

<!-- ### In the beginning...

I have always someone driven by creativity and feel.  Growing up my best friend [Joe](http://joesid.com/) and I were always building and creating things.  Someday I may write a post detailing the rocket car we built using [LEGO Technics](https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Technic-Rally-42077-Building/dp/B075QZMNY8/) & [Hobby Rocket Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_rocket). We loved to draw, and thought for certain we would make a video game someday (which could totally still happen).  Moving into High School I began to discover writing, and started writing short stories and poetry.  In 2002 at 19 years old I was nominated for Poet of the Year by the now dead Poetry.com for my poem [Breathe](/poetry/breathe).  

### Livin' the dream

Academia was not a strength in my youth, so by 2004 I started exploring music as my core focus and taught myself how to play guitar.  Fueled by the passion of becoming a rockstar, for the next few years I worked on refining that craft.  I reconnected with some friends from High School, and we moved in together and began playing and recording together.  The apartment quickly transformed into a recording studio, complete with a microphone stand in the shower.  Over time our group of friends and collaborators grew, and we recognized that this was more of a community than a band.  Thus we named our community 'E Washington Ave', after the street the core group was living on and where most of us would meet up and play.

### The catalyst

Back in those days, MySpace Music was the revolutionary new way to get your music online and promote your group.  Being the most technically inclined member of our group, I took it upon myself to manage our online presence and soon after discovered that I could write some very basic HTML & CSS to customize the look of our MySpace pages.  This is where my love affair with Web Design and Development began, and over the next few years I was able to nurture that love into a career.  I had discovered something that encompassed nearly all of my passions, and a burning fire was lit inside of me.  Like anything in life, you learn best by doing so I started building websites for people in my network while working as a Server, Bartender, & Barista.

Around 2010 I caught a break and was picked up by [Creative Circle](https://creativecircle.com/), a creative staffing agency.  They helped me land my first contract gig at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and the rest is history.  

### Back to the future

Fast forward to today, and I am coming off of a 5 year stint working as a Senior User Experience & Product Developer for [The SAVO Group](http://savogroup.com/).  SAVO was recently acquired by [Seismic](https://seismic.com/) which ended many peoples tenure there, myself included.  Over my time at SAVO the company was continually transforming, and each chapter taught me an incredible deal about the the world of software development.  Sometime soon I will write a post detailing my experience at SAVO and reflect on my experiences.

My time at SAVO allowed me to refine my craft, and gain exposure to new teams and concepts like User Experience, Agile, and practicing Lean Methodologies.  As my perception expanded I learned to embrace that not all problems can be solved with code. I was fortunate enough to play a role in building a team who infused the passion for their craft with a mutual purpose to grow and have an impact together.  We quickly grew into one of the best UI/UX teams many of our peers had the pleasure to work with, and together we impacted nearly every aspect of SAVO's organization.  

I prefer to surround myself with people who are humble and driven, and no longer have much patience for *ninjas* or *rockstars*.  Untapped potential excites me, and providing people with a platform to create and collaborate effectively in a supportive and encouraging environment is one of my favorite ways to contribute and nurture individual growth. -->
