Hello interwebs! Whoever you are that is currently here reading this post, you're awesome!  Thank you for taking the time to check me out.  If you haven't already done so, go ahead and [read up on me](/about/) and get to know who I am. Please don't hesitate to connect with me and share your deepest darkest fears and secrets.

As the title suggests, this is the first post on my cool new website built using the fantastic [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).  Gatsby calls itself a blazing-fast static site generator built for [React](https://reactjs.org/).  It is is a ton of fun to use, and I highly recommend people to check it out.  Gatsby has a ton of awesome [starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/) to get your site off the ground quickly, and this site was built using the [Lumen Starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen).

I have a broad amount of passions and interests, so as this site matures here are the things you can come to expect from me:

+ Posts about life, and the existential conundrums I find myself in.
+ The experiences I have traveling.
+ As an avid reader, I want to start writing book reports on the books that I read.  To both share the knowledge I find as valuable, and to help cement the content in my brain.
+ Thoughts and reflections on the tech industry
+ Website & Application Development Tutorials along with new learnings and challenges I overcome developing applications and websites.
+ Thoughts and concepts cover personal development, and the self-discover process.
+ Things that support a healthy lifestyle including exercise, diet, yoga, neurofeedback & nootropics.
+ I am a passionate gamer, so expect thoughts and impressions on video games, the state of game industry, eSports, and Destiny (Bungie pls).
+ As someone embracing their entrepreneurial spirit, I will be sharing experiences and reflections on starting and growing my own business.

Clearly I am just getting started and we have a lot of ground to cover, so please stay tuned and check back frequently to stay on top of new content as it is released. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, so consider this step number one.  I hope you will enjoy this journey with me!
